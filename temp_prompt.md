1 - family settings page still does not have left menu. So navigation from there is really tricky.

2 - Routing has dashboard prefix

Routing should not have dashboard in the url 

http://localhost:3000/dashboard/family/settings

http://localhost:3000/dashboard/reports

http://localhost:3000/dashboard/settings


3 - How can I access in the application? not sure how to test them. 

Can you create a guide to describre in a concise way how to test the all features implemented in version 1.1 ?

For example

- Enhanced Calendar Views (Weekly/Monthly)	
- Analytics Dashboard
- Points & Reward System
- Achievement Badges & Streaks	
- Leaderboard & Family Competition	
- Chromecast Integration


4 - Review left Menu

- Check if we are missing any links in the left menu 
- Once all needed entries are in the left menu revalidate all icons 

Complete theses than do a commit, push it to server


5 - Landing page 

You created me 2 versions of it 

Aprroach 2 : Playful 3D Interactive

Approach 5: Split-Screen Dual Persona

I kind of love the Trend: User-journey focused design

but I also loved the 3D interactions . 

Can we create an hybrid kind of approach 5 but with the 3d icons / anmations from approach 2

Complete theses than do a commit, push it to server once it is done
