## Risk Mitigation

### Risk: Scope Creep
- ✅ Mitigation: Stick to M1-M4 features only
- ✅ Out of scope documented in requirements.md

### Risk: Performance Issues
- ✅ Mitigation: Test on 4G, optimize images, use Code Splitting
- ✅ Monitor Lighthouse score

### Risk: Security Issues
- ✅ Mitigation: RLS policies tested, input validation with Zod, secrets in env vars
- ✅ Security checklist in dev-ops.md

### Risk: Schedule Slip
- ✅ Mitigation: Track hours weekly, adjust next sprints if needed
- ✅ Prioritize: M1 > M2 > M3 > M4

---

## Notes

- Estimate assumes 15-20 hours/week available
- Add 10-15% buffer for unknowns (already included in 116 hours)
- Can compress to 6 weeks with 20+ hours/week
- Can extend to 10 weeks with 12-15 hours/week
- Database schema finalized before Phase 1 begins
- All API routes follow REST convention with Zod validation
- All forms use React Hook Form + Zod pattern
- Mobile-first design throughout
